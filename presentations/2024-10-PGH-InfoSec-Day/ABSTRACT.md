Session Title: Your Governance Is (Still) Broken

Session Synopsis:

    Last year we talked about how hard Governance is (see the recording here). A year has passed, so what?

    Well, we haven't let it go. In this talk we will quickly recap the problem and then spend most of our time discussing how to fix it.

    Get a crash course in what tools and techniques can do for us today (and what they can't). We will explore AI-based tools and GRC Engineering with a focus
    on cutting out the buzz and getting to the point of what you can do today, what we should be able to do soon, and how to get started. Don't believe me? See
    my 2017 TRISS presentation on Machine Learning and AI where I was covering this topic in detail, before the AI craze.

Learning Objectives: In this talk we focus on solving Governance problems. There is no silver bullet tool or product that solves this today. But there has been
a lot of progress, and we can make life better.

Length of time Requested: Anywhere from 25-60 minutes

Sample Presentation (if available): N/A but this is related to my presentation last year here and the related presentation is in here
