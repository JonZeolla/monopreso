    Show a kitten rainbow while I describe a possible future. Meetings with data reports based on transcripts.<br/>
    - What does a possible future look like?<br />
    - The interface with Governance is video, audio, transcripts, and documentation/written/chat.<br />
    - It can automatically augment and assist meetings<br />
    -> Was an interim decision made which won't meet compliance requirements? What are the specific requirements, and is it<br />
    worth breaking them or adjusting the decision?<br />
    - It can replace meetings where people are asking questions or interpreting governance/requirements.<br />
    - Getting info / data during meetings / conversations which previously took days or weeks. Automatically deploy telemertry like<br />
    -> "I wonder how many of our systems already use disks that are encrypted at rest?"<br />
    - Event-driven Governance.<br />
    -> A contract expires, and all the Governance requirements are flagged and then a human can decide to remove it or move it to a<br />
    baseline/standard practice.<br />
    - Instantly know the origin(s) of a statement. Why do we need to do this?<br />
    -> Because the Governance is stored in modern DBs, we can have really useful metadata.<br />
    -> Was this a one-off request by an exec, who may be willing to bend if they knew it cost $20MM, or is it that AND a regluatory compliance obligation?<br />
