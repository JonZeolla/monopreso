    I wrote my first website using geocities in the '90s by reading the HTML spec and writing it by hand
    Later, I took programming classes and would add viruses into each program as kind of "don't click this" buttons
    Really, I just loved automating things

    Then I started working with large piles of data around 2014 and was bought-in on machine learning, and their potential to both classify and cluster data

    I heard about text embeddings and vectors via word2vec but I was convinced that it only applied to search or translation, so I didn't really care

    I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the intersection between machine learning, cloud native technologies, and GRC. How could we use this to pass audits?

    I landed on automated testing and really dug into ways to validate conformance to a specification - if I want it to do X, how can I be sure it does?
