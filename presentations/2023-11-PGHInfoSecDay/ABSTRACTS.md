Governance is hard. How do you describe how a company should run if you aren't even positive how it does run? The words we choose to put in Governance are
important; replace a SHOULD with a MUST and you can find yourself staring at a qualified opinion or a conditional approval.

Also, let's say you get asked by an executive why a certain sentence exists. Can you know for sure ALL of the reasons why it's there? Or just some of the
reasons? Can you really be 100% certain about ANY of the reasons why it's exactly worded how it is? If not, you may be concerned to touch it, and I would be
too.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Come to this talk and hear stories of the past ten years creating and being audited on Governance. How do you bridge the
gap between reducing toil via automation and enforcing your company values?

And don't worry, in this talk we will cover FREE open source tools and procedures that can help.
