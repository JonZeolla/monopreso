Too specific - Policies needing revision for algorithm updates or software versions
Saying that employees must have at least WPA2 encryption on their home wifi
Having specific departmental responsibilities.  Instead, compose it together based on team names and a mapping outside of the policy
Not specific enough - never referring to approved tools or where to find them
Having specific events / times in a policy.  LIke, we are gathering this and will have an update by DATE.
Grey areas and uncertain terms due to not being measured.
How approvals/exceptions are submit, tracked, managed.  “Unless approved by senior management” - is claiming that it was verbally approved OK?
Unsure where a statement came from, and why it’s there
Length - way too long and extra information not needed.
Should/May vs Must.  SLO vs SLA.  “All” statements vs compliance percentages.
Arbitrary timeframes like 90 days, 30 days, continuously, etc.
Having internal references to files that get renamed over time, causing auditability to be confusing. Renaming “rules” to “questionnaire” but not updating the reference to it in a Policy, etc.
Flow chart which is supported by words, connected together. Tight connection auto generated.
