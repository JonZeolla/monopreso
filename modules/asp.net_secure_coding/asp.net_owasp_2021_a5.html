    ### A5:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
    - Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack.
    - Unnecessary features are enabled or installed.
    - Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
    - Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.

    ### Prevention
    A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment.
