      ### A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration
      - Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the stack.
      - Unnecessary features are enabled or installed.
      - Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
      - Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.
      - The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.
