    ### Prevention
    - Ensure libraries and dependencies are consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile, consider hosting an internal known-good repository that's vetted.
    - Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the build and deploy processes.

    ### Prevention
    - Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.
    - Ensure that there is a review process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.
