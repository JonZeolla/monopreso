    You are likely vulnerable if:
    - You do not know the versions of your components (client and server-side), including those used via nested dependencies.
    - Software in your stack is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.
    - You do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly.
    - You do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion.
