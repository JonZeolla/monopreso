    Initially meant for Azure Roles

    Now they have "PIM for Groups" renamed in January 2023 from as PAGs (Privileged Access Groups).

    NEED to set it as role-enabled on group creation (recreating groups).

    You can set a group to make someone eligible to activate a PAG.
    - Consider Identity Governance and Access Review to do this. Make a Catalog containing Access Packages, which contain Resources that Users get access to.

    The Users and groups are who will be synced.

    Single sign-on is how you setup the SAML login federation between Azure and AWS.

    Provisioning is the actual SCIM provisioning. You setup attribute mappings, scoping filters, etc. here.

    Once this is all setup, you now have SSO!
    - Single place to manage accounts
    - Can use Azure Conditional Access Policies for MFA
    - One place for your identity logs
