    ## Command-line management
    - [Configuration files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) are good for low number of accounts/roles.
    - Environment variables are better for multiple accounts/roles, especially simultaneously ([example](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Configs/blob/a0a23b40233d440a1e4c754f74946c55b3bac0f8/apple/productivity/.zshrc#L198-L236))
