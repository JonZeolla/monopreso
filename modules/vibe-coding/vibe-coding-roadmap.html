  <p>Use version control (i.e. <code>git</code>) and linters.</p>
</section>
<section data-transition="none">
  <p>Ensure good unit / integration / e2e test coverage. Use LLMs to add coverage quickly</p>

<section data-transition="none">
  <p>Create custom context from your contracts, security policies, and product requirements</p>
</section>
<section data-transition="none">
  <p>Start using MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to enforce custom context in the IDE</p>
