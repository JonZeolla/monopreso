    my saas was built with Cursor, zero hand written code

    AI is no longer just an assistant, itâ€™s also the builder

    Now, you can continue to whine about it or start building.

    P.S. Yes, people pay for it

    guys, i'm under attack

    ever since I started to share how I built my SaaS using Cursor

    random thing are happening, maxed out usage on api keys, people bypassing the subscription, creating random shit on db

    as you know, I'm not technical so this is taking me longer that usual to figure out

    for now, I will stop sharing what I do publicly on X

    there are just some weird ppl out there

    i'm shutting down my app ðŸ˜‘

    Cursor just keeps breaking other parts of the code

    you guys were right, I shouldnâ€™t have deployed unsecured code to production

    I'll just rebuild it with Bubble, a more user friendly and secure platform for non techies like me

    I appreciate everyone for the support in the past 2 days

    not quitting so easy
