# Ideas for this presentation

- Mention OSCAL and where it fits into all this; pros and cons
- Mention the Policy WG white paper and GRC paper
- Highlight the Automated Governance maturity model and show an excerpt
- Show some examples of PaC; semgrep, rego, inspec, etc.
- What are some the biggest mistakes? Allowing refactors that have logic changes accidentally, failing pipelines going to prod accidentally, taking down prod,
  anything else?
