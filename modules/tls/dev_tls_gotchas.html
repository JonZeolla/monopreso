      <b>RSA is error-prone</b>
      <li>
        While RSA is not currently under realistic threat by quantum computing (Shor's algorithm), RSA implementations are frequently implemented improperly. Trail of bits did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lElHzac8DDI">presentation</a> and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">blog post</a> in 2019 covering the details.

      <b>TLS libraries</b>
      <li>
        OpenSSL is the swiss army knife, was <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/18-04-720-REP_v1.2.pdf">audited in January 2019</a>, and has a <a href="https://hackerone.com/directory?ibb=true">bug bounty program</a>.

        Alternatives include <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL from Google</a>, <a href="https://bearssl.org">BearSSL from Thomas Pornin</a>, and <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL which is an OpenSSL fork</a> intent on modernizing the codebase and improving security.
