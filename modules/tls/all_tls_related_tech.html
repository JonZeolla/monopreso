      TLS is not required, but many browser vendors require it.

      When TLS is in use, HTTP/2 mandates <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2">TLS 1.2 or newer</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2">SNI</a>, as well as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.1">disabling renegotiation and compression</a>.

        There are some <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-10">additional security considerations</a>, some of which apply to TLS and HTTP/2. For instance, HTTP/2 over TLS requires the use of ALPN which is a relatively new TLS extension, RFC 7301, which helps us negotiate the new HTTP version without losing valuable time or network packet round-trips. ALPN came from NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). ALPN primarily differs from NPN in who decides what protocol to speak. With ALPN the client tells the server a list of protocols in its order of preference and the server picks the one it wants, while with NPN the client makes that final choice.
