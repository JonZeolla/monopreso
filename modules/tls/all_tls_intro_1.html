  <h2>What is TLS</h2>
  <q cite="https://davidwong.fr/tls13/">The primary goal of TLS is to provide a secure channel between two communicating peers; the only requirement from the underlying transport is a reliable, in-order data stream.</q><br />

  <h2>What is TLS</h2>
  <q cite="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446">TLS allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.</q><br />
  - RFC 8446

  <h2>Typical Goals of using TLS</h2>

    <li>
      Nobody else can see this

    <li>
      We are who we say we are

      The data didn't change

  <h2>Typical server setup</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
      Create associated public (CSR, CRT, or Cert) and private (PEM or Key) information
    </li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
      Get your public information endorsed by a trusted third party
    </li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
      Publish that endorsement
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Configure the server to make communications with your clients private
    </li>
  </ol>

    <b>Certificates</b><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Certificates are X509v3 files, and one of their elements is the public key, which is signed by a CA.  There are numerous other elements of a certificate to hold information like the Organization name, etc.  There are also x509v3 extensions to hold things like the subjectAltName (SAN)
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The public key is embedded in the X509 certificate <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459#section-4.1.2.7">RFC2459 in section 4.1.2.7</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        The private key is associated with the public key using assymetric crypto
      </li>
      <li>
        CAs are preloaded in client OSs and/or browsers as a 'trusted third party'
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            X509v3 came out in 1999 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459
          </li>
          <li>
            In TLS 1.3 using x509v3 certificates are still preferred, although it's possible to negotiate a raw key via <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7250">RFC7250</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Extensions have an OID and an ASN.1 structure https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459#section-4.2</li>
    </ul>
