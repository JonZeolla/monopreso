## Abstracts

----
Getting Started with Security Policy as Code

Guardrails, not gates.

You've probably heard this before, but what does it mean? How could we apply it?

In this talk Jon Zeolla will cover some of the open source tools and standards which can be used to reduce the toil of compliance, turn policy into code instead of PDFs, and guide our teams towards secure-by-default environments using paved roads and Policy as Code.

If you've ever needed to pass an audit, you can probably appreciate how painful the process typically is. What if it didn't need to be that way?

With modern tooling and frameworks, we can layer automated security assessments on top of manual ones, and use standard, structured outputs to provide evidence
to audit teams that we are doing what we said we'd be doing. Even better, we can start to enforce these policies in our pipelines or at runtime to ensure we are
never put in a position where we are doing something that our organization doesn't allow.

Come listen to Jon Zeolla talk about some open source tools and standards which can be used to reduce the toil of compliance, and automate the detection of
policy.
